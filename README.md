# ParkAware
The ParkAware App is a mobile application designed to address the issue of unauthorized parking by enabling users to scan vehicle number plates and send anonymous notifications to vehicle owners. The app provides a seamless way to inform vehicle owners to move their vehicles without revealing personal contact details. By scanning the vehicle's number plate, the app retrieves the owner's information and allows users to send a pre-defined message requesting the vehicle's removal. This project aims to improve parking etiquette and resolve disputes without compromising privacy.

## Objectives
- **Enable easy vehicle number plate scanning**: Develop a user-friendly interface for scanning vehicle number plates using the mobile camera.
- **Retrieve vehicle owner information**: Integrate a secure database to fetch and verify vehicle owner details.
- **Anonymous messaging system**: Implement a feature to send messages to vehicle owners without disclosing their contact information.
- **Promote parking discipline**: Encourage responsible parking practices and reduce disputes related to unauthorized parking.
